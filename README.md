⚡My new portfolio using Next.js 13 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Sanity CMS⚡

I'm a passionate developer with +3 year of work experience in JavaScript/TypeScript, I'm a lover of page design or other things and whenever I can I try to learn new technologies since I discovered programming at 19 years old. I love what I do and I help others with what I can.

I also use in web and mobile development Next.js, React.js, TS, React Native and Flutter, to add I also have experience working in Backend with Express/Node and in the UX design part with Figma always implementing good practices in prototyping and coding, clean architecture, SOLID principles, pixel perfect and agile methodologies for example such as the SCRUM framework.

I am currently interested the way to be a DevOps, the reason why I am interested in this area is to know something different from programming and at the same time very useful in the present and in the future, in short I take it as an investment in myself in case I have a job that requires this skill.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
